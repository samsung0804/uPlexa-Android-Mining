## uPlexa Android Mining


### *Want to mine your favorite lowcap Monero fork on your Android devices? Well boy, do I have something for you.*


### The preamble

#### Never heard of uPlexa? Essentially, it is the true vision of Monero; _CPU, GPU and IoT Mining, happily cooexisting together._
#### uPlexa is headed by a strong core team, led by QuantumLeaper (Discord ID: 348787603321126912).
#### One potential usecase for uPlexa takes root in Asia, and certain parts of Europe, where people pay exorbitant amounts for electric. 
#### Why not take those electronic devices already sipping power, and let them mine crypto for you? 
#### And due to the UPX2 hashing algorithm, IoT devices have a HUGE leg-up on other devices - i.e. 11kH on my Snapdragon 855 _*phone*_ when my laptop does around the same.


### The preamble, round II

#### Why do you want to do this, in the first place, when the UPX Android Miner exists? Well, there are a handful of advantages to taking this route.
#### So, first off: You can set your own custom pools, and difficulty levels.
#### Second, you can turn off your screen while the miner runs, thus not burning into your screen the miner (for OLED/amOLED devices).
#### Third, there is a fairly massive hashrate increase. My Galaxy S10 (Snapdragon 855 model) gets about 9.5kH on _ice water_, whereas the same phone gets 11 on normal air with this route.
